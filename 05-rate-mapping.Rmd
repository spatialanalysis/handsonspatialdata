# Rate Mapping

## Introduction {-}

This notebook covers the functionality of the [Rate Mapping](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/3b_rates/lab3b.html) section of the GeoDa workbook. We refer to that document for details on the methodology, references, etc. The goal of these notes is to approximate as closely as possible the operations carried out using GeoDa by means of a range of R packages.

The notes are written with R beginners in mind, more seasoned R users can probably skip most of the comments
on data structures and other R particulars. Also, as always in R, there are typically several ways to achieve a specific objective, so what is shown here is just one way that works, but there often are others (that may even be more elegant, work faster, or scale better).

For this notebook, we use Cleveland house price data. Our goal in this lab is show how to assign spatial weights based on different distance functions.

### Objectives

After completing the notebook, you should know how to carry out the following tasks:

- Obtain a coordinate reference system

- Create thematic maps for rates

- Assess extreme value rate values by means of an excess risk map

- Understand the principle behind shrinkage estimation or smoothing rates

- Use base R to compute rates with bivariate operations

#### R Packages used

- **sf**: To read in the shapefile.

- **tmap**: To create various rate maps and build up the necessary custom specifications for the box map classification

- **geodaData**: To load the dataset for the notebook.

#### R Commands used

Below follows a list of the commands used in this notebook. For further details
and a comprehensive list of options, please consult the 
[R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org).

- **Base R**: `install.packages`, `library`, `setwd`, `class`, `str`, 

- **sf**: `plot`, `st_crs`, `st_set_geometry`

- **tmap**: `tm_shape`, `tm_fill`, `tm_borders`, `tm_layout`, `tmap_mode`, `tm_basemap`


## Preliminaries


### Load packages

First, we load all the required packages using the `library` command. If you don't have some of these in your system, make sure to install them first as well as
their dependencies.^[Use 
`install.packages(packagename)`.] You will get an error message if something is missing. If needed, just install the missing piece and everything will work after that.


```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(geodaData)
```

### geodaData

All of the data for the R notebooks is available in the **geodaData**
package. We loaded the library earlier, now to access the individual
data sets, we use the double colon notation. This works similar to
to accessing a variable with `$`, in that a drop down menu will 
appear with a list of the datasets included in the package. For this
notebook, we use `ohio_lung`.

```{r}
ohio_lung <- geodaData::ohio_lung
```




## Choropleth Map for Rates


### Spatially extensive and intensive variables

We start our discussion of rate maps by illustrating something we should not be
doing. This pertains to the important difference between a spatially extensive and a
spatially intensive variable. In many applications that use public health data, we
typically have access to a count of events, such as the number of cancer cases (a
spatially extensive variable), as well as to the relevant population at risk, which
allows for the calculation of a rate (a spatially intensive variable).

#### Setting up the Boxmap option


Throughout this notebook, we will be using the `boxmap` function, created in the 
previous notebook: Basic Mapping. We won't go into depth on how the function was created,
but for this information, check out the Basic Mapping notebook chapter.

```{r}
get.var <- function(vname,df) {
  # function to extract a variable as a vector out of an sf data frame
  # arguments:
  #    vname: variable name (as character, in quotes)
  #    df: name of sf data frame
  # returns:
  #    v: vector with values (without a column name)
  v <- df[vname] %>% st_set_geometry(NULL)
  v <- unname(v[,1])
  return(v)
}
```

```{r}
boxbreaks <- function(v,mult=1.5) {
  # break points for box map
  # arguments:
  #   v: vector with observations
  #   mult: multiplier for IQR (default 1.5)
  # returns:
  #   bb: vector with 7 break points
  # compute quartile and fences
  qv <- unname(quantile(v))
  iqr <- qv[4] - qv[2]
  upfence <- qv[4] + mult * iqr
  lofence <- qv[2] - mult * iqr
  # initialize break points vector
  bb <- vector(mode="numeric",length=7)
  # logic for lower and upper fences
  if (lofence < qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers
    bb[1] <- lofence
    bb[2] <- qv[1]
  } else {
    bb[2] <- lofence
    bb[1] <- qv[1]
  }
  if (upfence > qv[5]) { # no upper outliers
    bb[7] <- upfence
    bb[6] <- qv[5]
  } else {
    bb[6] <- upfence
    bb[7] <- qv[5]
  }
  bb[3:5] <- qv[2:4]
  return(bb)
}
```



```{r}
boxmap <- function(vnam,df,legtitle=NA,mtitle="Box Map",mult=1.5){
  # box map
  # arguments:
  #   vnam: variable name (as character, in quotes)
  #   df: simple features polygon layer
  #   legtitle: legend title
  #   mtitle: map title
  #   mult: multiplier for IQR
  # returns:
  #   a tmap-element (plots a map)
  var <- get.var(vnam,df)
  bb <- boxbreaks(var)
  tm_shape(df) +
     tm_fill(vnam,title=legtitle,breaks=bb,palette="-RdBu",
          labels = c("lower outlier", "< 25%", "25% - 50%", "50% - 75%","> 75%", "upper outlier"))  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = mtitle, title.position = c("right","bottom"),legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = "right")
}
```




```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
boxmap("LFW68", ohio_lung) +
  tm_basemap(server="OpenStreetMap",alpha=0.5)
```

Anyone familiar with the geography of Ohio will recognize the outliers as the
counties with the largest populations, i.e., the metropolitan areas of
Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, etc. The labels for these cities in the base
layer make this clear. This highlights a major problem with spatially
extensive variables like total counts, in that they tend to vary with the
size (population) of the areal units. So, everything else being the same, we
would expect to have more lung cancer cases in counties with larger
populations


Instead, we opt for a spatially intensive variable, such as the ratio of the
number of cases over the population. More formally, if $O_i$ is the number of cancer cases in area i, and $P_i$ is the corresponding population at risk (in
our example, the total number of white females), then the raw or crude rate
or proportion follows as:

$$r_i = \frac{O_i}{P_i}$$




#### Variance instability

The crude rate is an estimator for the unknown underlying risk. In our
example, that would be the risk of a white woman to be exposed to lung
cancer. The crude rate is an unbiased estimator for the risk, which is a
desirable property. However, its variance has an undesirable property, namely

$$Var[r_i] = \frac{\pi_i(1-\pi_i)}{P_i}$$
where $\pi_i$ is the underlying risk in area i. This implies that the larger
the population of an area ($P_i$ in the denominator), the smaller the
variance for the estimator, or, in other words, the greater the precision.

The flip side of this result is that for areas with sparse populations 
(small $P_i$), the estimate for the risk will be imprecise (large variance).
Moreover, since the population typically varies across the areas under
consideration, the precision of each rate will vary as well. This variance
instability needs to somehow be reflected in the map, or corrected for, to
avoid a spurious representation of the spatial distribution of the underlying
risk. This is the main motivation for smoothing rates, to which we return
below.



### Raw rate map

To compute the raw rate, we just divide the count of events by the population for each
county.
```{r}
ohio_lung$raw_rate <- ohio_lung$LFW68 / ohio_lung$POPFW68
```


We don't need the basemap for the rest of the notebook, so we switch back to plot
mode in **tmap**. This is done with `tmap_mode` plot. Using the `boxmap` function
from earlier we make a map of the lung cancer counts and the raw population based 
rates.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
p1 <- boxmap("LFW68", ohio_lung)
p2 <- boxmap("raw_rate", ohio_lung)
p2
```

With `tmap_arrange`, we can get a side by side comparison of the two maps.
```{r}
tmap_arrange(p1,p2,ncol = 2)
```

With the adjustment for population, the map becomes more meaningful than just
the raw count data. We see different upper outliers and a new spatial distribution after
this adjustment.



## Excess risk

### Relative risk

A commonly used notion in demography and public health analysis is the
concept of a standardized mortality rate (SMR), sometimes also referred to as
relative risk or excess risk. The idea is to compare the observed mortality
rate to a national (or regional) standard. More specifically, the observed
number of events is compared to the number of events that would be expected
had a reference risk been applied.

In most applications, the reference risk is estimated from the aggregate of
all the observations under consideration. For example, if we considered all
the counties in Ohio, the reference rate would be the sum of all the events
over the sum of all the populations at risk. Note that this average is not
the average of the county rates. Instead, it is calculated as the ratio of
the total sum of all events over the total sum of all populations at risk
(e.g., in our example, all the white female deaths in the state over the
state white female population). Formally, this is expressed as:


$$\pi=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}O_i}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}P_i}$$

which yields the expected number of events for each area i as:

$$E_i=\pi*P_i$$

The relative risk then follows as the ratio of the observed number of events
(e.g., cancer cases) over the expected number:

$$SMR_i=\frac{O_i}{E_i}$$



### Excess risk map

To calculate the excess risk of each county, we need to do a series of computations
first as opposed to GeoDa, which does it automatically. We start by calculating the 
reference rate, which is just the sum of events over the sum of the population.
```{r}
sum_observed <- sum(ohio_lung$LFW68)
sum_population <- sum(ohio_lung$POPFW68)
p_i <- sum_observed / sum_population
```


Next we calculate the expected number of events for each county based on the reference rate
for the whole state and the population for each county.
```{r}
E_i <- p_i * ohio_lung$POPFW68
```

Lasty, we divide the actual count by the expected count to get the relative risk rate.
This ratio will show us which counties have a higher than expected number of lung
cancer cases, and which counties have a lower than expected count.
```{r}
ohio_lung$smr <- ohio_lung$LFW68 / E_i
```


In the excess risk map, blue counties will indicate a risk lower than the state average, or
$SMR_i < 1$. Red counties indicate a risk higher than the state average, or $SMR_i > 1$.
```{r}
p1 <- tm_shape(ohio_lung) +
     tm_fill("smr",title="Excess risk",breaks=c(-100,.25,.5,1,2,4,1000),labels = c("<.25", ".25 - .50", ".50 - 1.00","1.00 - 2.00", "2.00 - 4.00", "> 4.00" ), palette = "-RdBu")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = "right")
p1
```


Additionally, we can examine the excess risk rate in the form of a boxmap. The boxmap
utilizes the full distribution of the rates to identify outliers, compared to the relative
risk map, which identifies them as having a value greater than two.
```{r}
p2 <- boxmap("smr",ohio_lung)
p2
```



Here we use `tmap_arrange` to get a side by side comparison again.
```{r}
tmap_arrange(p1,p2,ncol = 2)
```




## Empirical Bayes Smoothed Rate Map





### Borrowing strength

As mentioned in the introduction, rates have an intrinsic variance instability,
which may lead to the identification of spurious outliers. In order to correct
for this, we can use smoothing approaches (also called shrinkage estimators),
which improve on the precision of the crude rate by borrowing strength from the
other observations. This idea goes back to the fundamental contributions of James
and Stein (the so-called James-Stein paradox), who showed that in some instances
biased estimators may have better precision in a mean squared error sense.

GeoDa includes three methods to smooth the rates: an Empirical Bayes approach^[There are several excellent books and articles on Bayesian statistics, with @gcsdvr14 as a classic reference.], a
spatial averaging approach, and a combination between the two. We will consider
the spatial approaches after we discuss distance-based spatial weights. Here, we
focus on the Empirical Bayes (EB) method. First, we provide some formal
background on the principles behind smoothing and shrinkage estimators.


### Bayes law

The formal logic behind the idea of smoothing is situated in a Bayesian
framework, in which the distribution of a random variable is updated after
observing data. The principle behind this is the so-called Bayes Law, which
follows from the decomposition of a joint probability (or density) into two
conditional probabilities:

$$P[AB] = P[A|B]*P[B] = P[B|A]*P[A]$$

where A and B are random events, and | stands for the conditional probability of
one event, given a value for the other. The second equality yields the formal
expression of Bayes law as:

$$P[A|B] = \frac{P[B|A]*P[A]}{P[B]}$$
In most instances in practice, the denominator in this expression can be ignored,
and the equality sign is replaced by a proportionality sign:

$$P[A|B]\propto P[B|A]*P[A]$$



$$P[\pi|y]\propto P[Y|\pi] * P[\pi]$$



### The Poisson-Gamma model

For each particular estimation problem, we need to specify distributions for the
prior and the likelihood in such a way that a proper posterior distribution
results. In the context of rate estimation, the standard approach is to specify a
Poisson distribution for the observed count of events (conditional upon the risk
parameter), and a Gamma distribution for the prior of the risk parameter $\pi$.
This is referred to as the Poisson-Gamma model^[For an extensive discussion, see, for example, the classic papers by @ck87 and @m91.].

In this model, the prior distribution for the (unknown) risk parameter $\pi$ is
$Gamma(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the shape and scale
parameters of the Gamma distribution. In terms of the more familiar notions of
mean and variance, this implies:

$$E[\pi] = \alpha/\beta$$
and

$$Var[\pi] = \alpha/\beta^2$$

Using standard Bayesian principles, the combination of a Gamma prior for the risk
parameter with a Poisson distribution for the count of events (O) yields the
posterior distribution as $Gamma(O+\alpha,P + \beta)$. The new shape and scale
parameters yield the mean and variance of the posterior distribution for the risk
parameter as:

$$E[\pi]= \frac{O+ \alpha}{P + \beta}$$

and

$$Var[\pi] = \frac{O + \alpha}{(P+\beta)^2}$$

Different values for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters (reflecting more or less
precise prior information) will yield smoothed rate estimates from the posterior
distribution. In other words, the new risk estimate adjusts the crude rate with
parameters from the prior Gamma distribution.



### The Empirical Bayes approach

In the Empirical Bayes approach, values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the prior
Gamma distribution are estimated from the actual data. The smoothed rate is then
expressed as a weighted average of the crude rate, say r, and the prior estimate,
say $\theta$. The latter is estimated as a reference rate, typically the overall
statewide average or some other standard.

In essense, the EB technique consists of computing a weighted average between the
raw rate for each county and the state average, with weights proportional to the
underlying population at risk. Simply put, small counties (i.e., with a small
population at risk) will tend to have their rates adjusted considerably, whereas
for larger counties the rates will barely change^[For an extensive technical discussion, see also @alk06].

More formally, the EB estimate for the risk in location i is:
$$\pi_i^{EB}=w_ir_i + (1-w_i)\theta$$

In this expression, the weights are:

$$w_i = \frac{\sigma^2}{(\sigma^2 + \mu/P_i)}$$


with $P_i$ as the population at risk in area i, and $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ as the
mean and variance of the prior distribution.

In the empirical Bayes approach, the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ of the
prior (which determine the scale and shape parameters of the Gamma distribution)
are estimated from the data.

For $\mu$ this estimate is simply the reference rate(the same reference used in
the computation of SMR), $\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}O_i/\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}P_i$. The
estimate of the variance is a bit more complex:

$$\sigma^2=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}P_i(r_i-\mu)^2}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}P_i}-\frac{\mu}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}P_i/n}$$

While easy to calculate, the estimate for the variance can yield negative values.
In such instances, the conventional approach is to set $\sigma^2$ to zero. As a
result, the weight $w_i$ becomes zero, which in essence equates the smoothed rate
estimate to the reference rate.



## EB rate map

We start by computing all of the necessary parameters for the variance formula above.
This includes $\mu$, n , the crude rate, $r_i$, $O_i$, and $P_i$.
```{r}
mu <- sum(ohio_lung$LFW68) / sum(ohio_lung$POPFW68)
O_i <- ohio_lung$LFW68
P_i <- ohio_lung$POPFW68
n <- length(ohio_lung$POPFW68)
r_i <- O_i / P_i
```

Next we compute the variance, to similify the code, we compute the top left portion or
$$\Sigma_{i=1}^{i=n}P_i(r_i-\mu)^2$$ as **top_left**, then compute the variance with the
next line.
```{r}
top_left <- sum(P_i * (r_i - mu)^2)
variance <- top_left / sum(P_i) - mu / sum(P_i / n)
```


Now that we have the variance, we can compute the $w_i$ values.
```{r}
w_i <- variance / (variance + mu/P_i)
```

Here we use the final formula for the smoothed rates.
```{r}
ohio_lung$eb_bayes <- w_i * r_i + (1 - w_i) * mu 
ohio_lung$eb_bayes
```


Lastly, we plot the EB smoothed rates with the `boxmap` function.
```{r}
boxmap("eb_bayes",ohio_lung)
```


In comparison to the box map for the crude rates and the excess rate map, none of the
original outliers remain identified as such in the smoothed map. Instead, a new outlier is
shown in the very southwestern corner of the state (Hamilton county).

Since many of the original outlier counties have small populations at risk (check in the
data table), their EB smoothed rates are quite different (lower) from the original. In
contrast, Hamilton county is one of the most populous counties (it contains the city of
Cincinnati), so that its raw rate is barely adjusted. Because of that, it percolates to the
top of the distribution and becomes an outlier.
