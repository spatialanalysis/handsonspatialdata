# Global Spatial Autocorrelation 1

## Introduction {-}

This notebook cover the functionality of the [Global Spatial Autocorrelation 1](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/5a_global_auto/lab5a.html) section of the GeoDa workbook. We refer to that document for details on the methodology, references, etc. The goal of these notes is to approximate as closely as possible the operations carried out using GeoDa by means of a range of R packages.

The notes are written with R beginners in mind, more seasoned R users can probably skip most of the comments
on data structures and other R particulars. Also, as always in R, there are typically several ways to achieve a specific objective, so what is shown here is just one way that works, but there often are others (that may even be more elegant, work faster, or scale better).

For this notebook, we use Cleveland house price data. Our goal in this lab is show how to assign spatial weights based on different distance functions.

## Preliminaries

Before starting, make sure to have the latest version of R and of packages that are compiled for the matching version of R (this document was created using R 3.5.1 of 2018-07-02). Also, optionally, set a working directory, even though we will not
actually be saving any files.^[Use `setwd(directorypath)` to specify the working directory.]

### Load packages

First, we load all the required packages using the `library` command. If you don't have some of these in your system, make sure to install them first as well as
their dependencies.^[Use 
`install.packages(packagename)`.] You will get an error message if something is missing. If needed, just install the missing piece and everything will work after that.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(spdep)
library(ggplot2)
library(deldir)
library(robustHD)
library(Hmisc)
library(tidyverse)
library(gap)
library(gridExtra)
library(geodaData)
```

### geodaData website {-}

All of the data for the R notebooks is available in the **geodaData**
package. We loaded the library earlier, now to access the individual
data sets, we use the double colon notation. This works similar to
to accessing a variable with `$`, in that a drop down menu will 
appear with a list of the datasets included in the package. For this
notebook, we use `clev_pts`.

Otherwise, to get the data for this notebook, you will and to go to [Cleveland Home Sales](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab//clev_sls_154_core/) The download format is a
zipfile, so you will need to unzip it by double clicking on the file in your file
finder. From there move the resulting folder titled: nyc into your working directory
to continue. Once that is done, you can use the **sf** function: `st_read()` to read
the shapefile into your R environment. 

```{r}
clev.points <- geodaData::clev_pts
```

### Making the weights


The weights used for this notebook are queen contiguity, based off voronoi polygons contructed
from the point data for this notebook. In order to make the weights, we must first construct
voronoi polygons from the cleveland point data. There are a number of ways to do this. We 
will be using the **deldir** package as a starting point. We will need to convert the result from
the **deldir** package to class **sf**, which we have been working with throughout the notebooks.

The only function we need from **deldir** is `deldir`, which outputs a data structure with 
voronoi polygons. The only inputs needed are a vector of the x coordinates and a vector of the y 
coordinates. The base R `plot` function can give us a preliminary look at the voronoi polygons. 
We will need a few additional parameters other than **vtess**, so the plot is legitable. 
Set `wlines = "tess"`, `wpoints = "none"` and `lty = 1`.
```{r,message=FALSE}
vtess <- deldir(clev.points$x, clev.points$y)
plot(vtess, wlines="tess", wpoints="none",
      lty=1)
```

This function will be used to convert the **deldir** voronoi polygons to **sp**, where we
can easily convert them to **sf**. We are not going to cover the individual steps of this
function because it is outside the scope of these notebooks. The important thing to note 
here is that this function converts **deldir** voronoi polygons to **sp**.
```{r}
voronoipolygons = function(thiess) {
w = tile.list(thiess)
polys = vector(mode='list', length=length(w))
for (i in seq(along=polys)) {
    pcrds = cbind(w[[i]]$x, w[[i]]$y)
    pcrds = rbind(pcrds, pcrds[1,])
    polys[[i]] = Polygons(list(Polygon(pcrds)), ID=as.character(i))
}
SP = SpatialPolygons(polys)
 voronoi = SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(SP, data=data.frame(dummy = seq(length(SP)), row.names=sapply(slot(SP, 'polygons'), 
    function(x) slot(x, 'ID'))))
}
```

Again, we can use the base R `plot` function to take a look at voronoi polygons. Now that they 
are class **sp**, we don't need the extra parameters in `plot`.
```{r}
v <- voronoipolygons(vtess)
plot(v)
```

With the voronoi polygons in **sp** class, we can easily conert them to **sf** with
`st_as_sf`. Again we use the base R `plot` function to view the polygons.
```{r}
vtess.sf <- st_as_sf(v)
plot(vtess.sf$geometry)
```

Now that we have the voronoi polygons as an **sf** object, we can use the queen contiguity
process outline in the Contiguity Based Weights notebook. We will briefly cover
each step of the process. For more indepth information please see the Contiguity 
Based Weights notebook.

To start we create a function for queen contiguity, which is just `st_relate` with
the specified pattern for queen contiguity which is `F***T****`
```{r}
st_queen <- function(a, b = a) st_relate(a, b, pattern = "F***T****")
```

We apply the queen contiguity function to the voronoi polygons and see that the class
of the output is **sgbp**. This structure is close to the **nb** structure, but has
a few differences that we will need to correct to use the rest of **spdep** functionality.
```{r}
queen.sgbp <- st_queen(vtess.sf)
class(queen.sgbp)
```

This function converts type **sgbp** to **nb**. It is covered in more depth in the 
Contiguity Based Weight notebook. In short, it explicitly changes the name of the 
class and deals with the observations that have no neighbors.
```{r}
as.nb.sgbp <- function(x, ...) {
  attrs <- attributes(x)
  x <- lapply(x, function(i) { if(length(i) == 0L) 0L else i } )
  attributes(x) <- attrs
  class(x) <- "nb"
  x
}
```


We use `as.nb.sgbp` to convert neighbor types and then check the class with `class`.
```{r}
queen.nb <- as.nb.sgbp(queen.sgbp)
class(queen.nb)
```

To go from neighbors object to weights object, we use `nb2listw`, with default parameters, we will 
get row standardized weights.
```{r}
queen.weights <- nb2listw(queen.nb)
```

## The Moran Scatter Plot

### Concept

#### Moran's I

Moran’s I statistic is arguably the most commonly used indicator of global spatial
autocorrelation. It was initially suggested by @m48, and popularized through
the classic work on spatial autocorrelation by @co73. In essence, it is
a cross-product statistic between a variable and its spatial lag, with the variable
expressed in deviations from its mean. For an observation at location i, this is
expressed as $z_i = x_i - \bar{x}$, where $\bar{x}$is the mean of variable x.

Moran's I statistic is then: 

$$I = \frac{\Sigma_i\Sigma_jw_{ij}z_iz_j/S_0}{\Sigma_iz_i^2/n}$$
with $w_{ij}$ as elements of the spatial weights matrix, $S_0 = \Sigma_i\Sigma_jw_{ij}$
as the sum of all of the weights and n as the number of observations.

#### Permutation inference

Inference for Moran’s I is based on a null hypothesis of spatial randomness. The
distribution of the statistic under the null can be derived using either an
assumption of normality (independent normal random variates), or so-called
randomization (i.e., each value is equally likely to occur at any location)^[While the analytical derivations provide easy to interpret expressions for the mean and the variance of the statistic under the null hypothesis, inference based on them employs an approximation to a standard normal distribution, which may be inappropriate when the underlying assumptions are not satisfied. See @co73 or @81 for extensive technical discussion.].

An alternative to an analytical derivation is a computational approach based on
permutation. This calculates a reference distribution for the statistic under the
null hypothesis of spatial randomness by randomly permuting the observed values
over the locations. The statistic is computed for each of these randomly
reshuffled data sets, which yields a reference distribution.

This distribution is then used to calculate a so-called pseudo p-value. This is
found as
$$p = \frac{R +1}{M+1}$$
where R is the number of times the computed Moran’s I from the spatial random data
sets (the permuted data sets) is equal to or more extreme than the observed
statistic. M equals the number of permutations. The latter is typically taken as
99, 999, etc., to yield nicely rounded pseudo p-values.

The pseudo p-value is only a summary of the results from the reference
distribution and should not be interpreted as an analytical p-value. Most
importantly, it should be kept in mind that the extent of significance is
determined in part by the number of random pemutations. More precisely, a result
that has a p-value of 0.01 with 99 permutations is not necessarily more
significant than a result with a p-value of 0.001 with 999 permutations.

#### Moran scatter plot

The Moran scatter plot, first outlined in @a96, consists of a plot with the spatially
lagged variable on the y-axis and the original variable on the x-axis. The slope of the linear fit to
the scatter plot equals Moran’s I.

We consider a variable z, given in deviations from the mean. With row-standardized weights, the sum
of all the weights (S0) equals the number of obsevations (n). As a result, the expression for Moran’s
I simplifies to:


$$I= \frac{\Sigma_i\Sigma_jw_{ij}z_iz_j}{\Sigma_iz_i^2} = \frac{\Sigma_i(z_i*\Sigma_jw_{ij}z_j)}{\Sigma_iz_i^2}$$

Upon closer examination, this turns out to be the slope of a regression of $\Sigma_jw_{ij}z_i$ on $z_i$
This is the principle underlying the Moran scatter plot.

An important aspect of the visualization in the Moran scatter plot is the classification of the
nature of spatial autocorrelation into four categories. Since the plot is centered on the mean (of
zero), all points to the right of the mean have $z_i>0$ and all points to the left have $z_i<0$. 
We refer to these values respectively as high and low, in the limited sense of higher or lower than
average. Similarly, we can classify the values for the spatial lag above and below the mean as high
and low.

The scatter plot is then easily decomposed into four quadrants. The upper-right
quadrant and the lower-left quadrant correspond with positive spatial
autocorrelation (similar values at neighboring locations). We refer to them as
respectively high-high and low-low spatial autocorrelation. In contrast, the
lower-right and upper-left quadrant correspond to negative spatial autocorrelation
(dissimilar values at neighboring locations). We refer to them as respectively
high-low and low-high spatial autocorrelation.

The classification of the spatial autocorrelation into four types begins to make
the connection between global and local spatial autocorrelation. However, it is
important to keep in mind that the classification as such does not imply
significance. This is further explored in our discussion of local indicators of
spatial association (LISA).

### Creating a Moran scatter plot

Before we create the Moran's I scatterplot, we will get the statistic using `moran` from
**spdep**. For this function, we need the a variable to do the Moran's I on, a weights
structure, the length of the dataset, and then `Szero` of the queen
weights, which calculates the constants needed for tests of spatial
autocorrelation.
```{r}
moran <- moran(clev.points$sale_price, queen.weights, length(queen.nb), Szero(queen.weights))
moran$I
```
We get a value of .281, which is the Moran's I statistic, which also 
corresponds to the slope of the Moran's I scatter plot.

In creating the Moran's I scatterplot, we will need to to create a lag variable of sale price from
our queen weights. This is just done with the function `lag.listw`, which takes a weights structure 
and a variable of equal length to create a lag variable from.
```{r}
clev.points$lagged_sale_price <- lag.listw(queen.weights,clev.points$sale_price)
clev.points$lagged_sale_price
```


We need standardized values for both the lag variable and the sale price variable 
to build the Moran'I scatterplot. Standardized values are just z scores for each 
observation($z_i =\frac{ x_i -\mu}{\sqrt{Var(x)}}$). To get the standardized values, we will use `standardize`
from the **robustHD** package. We could very easily calculate these with Base R
vectorized operations, but it is faster to just use a package function.
```{r}
clev.points$standardized_sale_price <- standardize(clev.points$sale_price)
clev.points$standardized_lag_sale_price <- standardize(clev.points$lagged_sale_price)
```


To construct the moran's I scatterplot, we will use **ggplot2** for more aesthically
pleasing plots. We will not go into too much depth on the options available for
for these plots, but for more information, check out [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html). In addition, The first
Exploratory Data Analysis notebook is also a good resource to look at. 

To make the Moran's I scatterplot, we make a scatterplot in **ggplot2**
with the standardized sale price values as the x axis and the 
standardized lag sale price variable as the y axis. We use `geom_point` to add the points to the plot. `geom_smooth` adds a regression line. The
default option is a loess smooth line, we specify the `method = lm` to get a standard linear regression line . We add dotted lines at the
x and y axis to separate the 4 types of spatial autocorrelation. We do this with
`geom_hline` for the x axis and `geom_vline` for the y axis. To get the speciifcations of
the scatterplot to better match up with GeoDa, we set the x and y scale limits to -10 and 10.
```{r}
ggplot(data = clev.points, aes(x=standardized_sale_price, y = standardized_lag_sale_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  xlim(-10,10) +
  ylim(-10,10) + 
  ggtitle("Moran scatter plot sale price")
```

#### Interpretation

We can see that the shape of the point cloud is determined by the presence of
several outliers on the high end (e.g., larger than three standard deviational
units from the mean). One observation, with a sales price of 527,409 (compared to
the median sales prices of 20,000), is as large as 8 standard deviational units
above the mean. On the lower end of the spectrum (to the left of the dashed line
in the middle that represents the mean), there is much less spread in the house
prices, and those points end up bunched together. By eliminating some of the
outliers, one may be able to see more detail for the remaining observations, but
we will not pursue that here.

#### Assessing significance

We have an estimate of the Moran's I statistic, but no information on the significance
of that statistic. This can be obtained by constructing a distribution by means of
random assignment. In order to do this, we first choose the number of permutations desired,
which will directly affect the minimum pseudo p-value we can obtain for the test statistic.
In the case of 999 permutation the minimum p-value would be .001, which would mean none
of the sample distribution statistics are as extreme or more extreme than the test statistic.

##### Replicability - the random seed

To faciliate replication, it is best to set a seed for the random number generator. The one
used in GeoDa is 123456789, so we will demonstrate how to set the seed here. It is just 
`set.seed` and the desired seed number as an input.
```{r}
set.seed(123456789)
```
#### Reference distribution

To make the reference distribution, we
will need to draw 999 randomized samples of the housing point data of the same 
size as the number of observations in the housing point data. This random
sample will allow us to assign the values to random locations, which will give
us a spatially random distribution. To get to this point, we will build up in steps
in order to better understand the process.

We start by taking one random sample of our points with the base R `sample`
function. We choose the same size as the number of sale price data observations
to make a spatially randomized vector of our sale price data. The point of this is to randomly
assign the housing prices to the voronoi polygons, then to compute the Moran's I
statistic for the spatially random assignment based off the original weights structure.
```{r}
draw <- sample(clev.points$sale_price, size = length(clev.points$sale_price))
draw
```

Now we can begin to calculate the Moran's I statistic by first calculating the 
spatial lag variable based on our queen weights and the spatially random sample.
```{r}
lag1 <- lag.listw(queen.weights,draw)
```

We can get the Moran's I statistic by regressing the standardized values of 
the spatial lag variable on the standardized values of the random draw. We 
can get the standardized value with the `standardize` function. The `summary`
function allows us to see a summary of the regression statistics. 
```{r}
lmfit <- lm(standardize(lag1) ~ standardize(draw))
summary(lmfit)
```
The slope here is the estimate for **standardize(draw)**. This value is fairly 
close to zero as the randomization process makes makes the draw spatially random.

To build our distribution, we will need to repeat this process many times over.
We can accomplish this by way of a `for` loop. We will need somewhere to store 
our Moran's I result for each iteration. To do this we will make an empty 
vector of a length corresponding to our desired number of permutations.
```{r}
randomized_moran <- rep(NA, 999)
```

The process here is the same as the one followed for one draw, but here we use the 
`for` loop to get 999 iterations and store the resulting Moran's I values in the vector 
that we created above. First we do the random sample with the `sample` function.
Then we make a lag variable based upon the random draw and our queen weights. Next
we run the regression with the `lm` function between the stanardized values
of the lag variable and random draw variable. Lastly, we extract the slope 
coefficient which is our Moran's I statistic and store it in index i. Each 
iteration of the loop will store the value at the subsequent index ie 1, then 2,
then 3, and so on.
```{r}
for(i in 1:999){
  draw <- sample(clev.points$sale_price, size = length(clev.points$sale_price))
  lag <- lag.listw(queen.weights,draw)
  lmfit <- lm(standardize(lag) ~ standardize(draw))
  randomized_moran[i] <- lmfit$coefficients[2] 
}
```

We can obtain summary statistics of our distribution with `summary`
```{r}
summary(randomized_moran)

```

```{r}
sd(randomized_moran)
```

Now to get the p value, we will check the number of samples that had higher Moran's I
statistic than the observed value. To do this, we use the base R `which` function
to get a vector of the indices at which the conditional is TRUE. We then get the length
of the vector with `length`. 
```{r}
length(which(randomized_moran > .281))
```
Since the result is 1, there is only 1 value in all of the permutations that is higher 
than the test statistic. This means that the p value is .002, $\frac{1 + R}{1 + M}$, where 
R = 1 and M = 999.

There are a number of ways we can visualize the distribution that we just constructed
in R. We will use **ggplot2** to do these visualizations because it looks much 
better than base R visualizations.

To start, we convert our vector with the randomized moran's I values into a data frame, 
so we can use **ggplot2** functions. For this, we just use the `data.frame` function with
the vector of randomized moran's I values as an argument and then assign a name for the 
column, which is just `moran` in this case.

The first option is a density plot. This requires the standard `ggplot` function with 
`aes` containing the x axis. Additionally we need `geom_density`. We use `geom_vline`
to plot the mean of the distribution and our observed statistic.
```{r}
df <- data.frame(moran = randomized_moran)
ggplot(data = df,aes(x=moran)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = moran[[1]], col = "green") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(randomized_moran), col = "blue")
```

The next option is a histogram. The only difference here is that we use `geom_histogram`
instead of `geom_density.
```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x=moran)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = moran[[1]], col = "green") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(randomized_moran), col = "blue")
```
#### LOWESS smoother

The LOWESS smoother is not implemented directly in **ggplot2**, but can be found in an
add-on package. We use the **Hmisc** package to add this functionality to the 
**ggplot2** plots. To add the smoother to our Moran's I scatter plot, we use the 
`stat_plsmo` from the **Hmisc** package. The default span for GeoDa is .2 so we will
set the `span =` parameter to .2.

With the LOWESS smoother, we can see potential structural breaks in the pattern of 
spatial autocorrelation. For example some parts of the data, the curve may be very steep,
and positive, indicating strong spatial autocorrelation, whereas in other parts, it
could be flat, indicating no spatial autocorrelation.
```{r}
ggplot(data = clev.points, aes(x=standardized_sale_price, y = standardized_lag_sale_price)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_plsmo(span = .2, color = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  xlim(-10,10) +
  ylim(-10,10) + 
  ggtitle("LOWESS smooth of Moran Scatterplot")
```

#### Chow test Moran's I scatterplot

The Chow test is a statistical test of whether or not the coeffiecients of two
different linear regressions are equal. In the case of the Moran's I scatterplot,
it is just the slope of the regression line and the intercepts, since it is a simple 
linear regression.

The brushing operation in GeoDa is fairly difficult to implement in R, but we can
do a less interactive version. First we must consider which criteria we want to 
select points on. This could be anything from its location to other characteristics
in the data. In our case we will do it based on location. As an approximation for the 
midpoint of the set of points, we take the the mean of the x and y coordinates. 
From there we assign "Select" to the points in the bottom left quadrant and "Rest"
to the rest of the points by way of the `if_else` function. This function takes
a conditional, a result to assign in the case where the conditional is TRUE, and
a result to assign when the conditional is FALSE. In our case it is "Select" and 
"Rest".

```{r}
mid_x <- mean(clev.points$x)
mid_y <- mean(clev.points$y)
clev.points<- clev.points %>% mutate(bottom_left = if_else((x < mid_x & y < mid_y),"Select", "Rest"))
```


Before we run the chow test, we will visualize the difference in slopes of the selected data, non-selected
data and the aggregate data^[This is a visual implementation of a regionalized Moran’s I, where the indicator of spatial autocorrelation is calculated for a subset of the observations (@mm96)]. With **ggplot2**, we can accomplish this by setting categorical colors based
whether or not an observation is "Selected" or "Rest". To do this, we specify `aes(color = bottom_left)` in
both `geom_point` and `geom_smooth`. This will give us colored points and regression lines for "Selected"
and "Rest". Then to get blue and red colors, we use `scale_color_manual`. For this plot, we do not set 
x and y limits because the -10 to 10 speciifcation is too dificult to see the differences in the regression
lines.

```{r}
ggplot(clev.points, aes(x=standardized_sale_price,y=standardized_lag_sale_price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=bottom_left)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color=bottom_left), method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("blue","red"))  +
  labs(color="Selection") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  ggtitle("Chow test Moran Scatterplot")
```

To perform the chow test, we need two separate data frames as inputs for the function. To get the 
two data frames, we use the **tidyverse** `filter` function. This function filter out observations
based on a conditional. TRUE values for the conditional remain in the data frame while FALSE values are
filtered out.
```{r}
clev.select <- clev.points %>% filter(bottom_left == "Select")
clev.rest <- clev.points %>% filter(bottom_left == "Rest")
```

Now we use the base R `lm` function to run separate regressions on the standardized lag variable and 
standardized sale price variable.

```{r}
reg.select <- lm(standardized_lag_sale_price~standardized_sale_price, data=clev.select)
reg.rest <- lm(standardized_lag_sale_price~standardized_sale_price, data=clev.rest)
```

Now we use the `summary` function on each regression object to get summary statistics of the residuals,
the regression coefficients and and their respective standard errors, the R squared values, and the 
F statistic.

```{r}
summary(reg.select)
```


```{r}
summary(reg.rest)
```
We see that the slopes vary by about .08 and the intercepts vary by .25


To run the chow test, we need 4 inputs for `chow.test`. We need the two standardized
variables from the the "Select" data frame: **clev.select** and the two standardized
variables from the the "Rest" data frame: **clev.rest**.
```{r}
chow <- chow.test(clev.select$standardized_lag_sale_price, clev.select$standardized_sale_price, clev.rest$standardized_lag_sale_price, clev.rest$standardized_sale_price)
chow
```
With a p-value of .103 we do not have significant evidence to conclude that the slopes of the 
two regressions are different under a standard alpha level of .05.


## Spatial Correlogram

### Concept

A non-parametric spatial correlogram is an alternative measure of global spatial
autocorrelation that does not rely on the specification of a spatial weights
matrix. Instead, a local regression is fit to the covariances or correlations
computed for all pairs of observations as a function of the distance between them
(for example, as outlined in @bf01)^[See also @hp94 for technical discussion of the general principle.].


With standardized variables z, this boils down to a local regression:


$$z_iz_j = f(d_{ij}) + u$$

where $d_{ij}$ is the distance between a pair of locations i - j, u is an
error term and f is a non-parametric function to be determined from the data.
Typically, the latter is a LOWESS or kernel regression.


### Creating a spatial correlogram

In GeoDa, creating a spatial correlogram is much more straight forward than
in R. The process in r requires us to start with the sale price points, then to 
create a neighbors structure base on the distance breaks desired for the 
correlogram.

To start, we use `cbind` to put the x and y coordinates together for use in
the distance based neighbor functions of **spdep**.

```{r}
coords <- cbind(clev.points$x, clev.points$y)
```

Now we create distance based neighbors coordinate matrix and lower distance bound and an upper distance bound, which is used to define neighbors. We use `dnearneigh` to create
the distance band neighbors. For more in depth information on distance based neighbors,
please see the Disatnce Based Weights notebook. We use a distance of 4823.27 to emulate
the first example in the GeoDa workbook.

```{r}
dist.band.nb <- dnearneigh(coords,0,4823.27)
```

Using the **spdep** function `sp.correlogram, we can get measures of spatial autocorrelation
for an input number of lag orders. We can then use the base R plotting function to get a look
at the autocorrelation values for each lag order.
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
sp <- sp.correlogram(dist.band.nb, clev.points$sale_price, order = 10, method = "I",style = "W", randomisation = TRUE, spChk = NULL, zero.policy = TRUE)
plot(sp)
```

To get a better looking plot, we can extract the moran's I values and put
them into a data frame, so we can use **ggplot2** plotting functionality.
```{r}
morans <- sp$res[,1]
df <- data.frame(Morans_I = morans,lags = 1:10 )
ggplot(data = df, aes(x=lags,y=Morans_I)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(col = "purple", se = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  ylim(-.5,.5) 
```

To get closer to the GeoDa correlogram plotting functionality, we can convert lags to 
euclidean distance.

```{r}
df$euclidean_distance <- df$lags * 4823.3
ggplot(data = df, aes(x=euclidean_distance,y=Morans_I)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(col = "purple", se = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  ylim(-.5,.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = df$euclidean_distance)
```



The spatial correlogram can be paired with a bar chart that shows the number of 
neighbor pairs for each lag order. To get this information, we will need to work
outside the **spdep** package and compute them ourselves.

To begin, we set up an empty vector to store the pair numbers.
```{r}
pairs <- rep(NA, 10)
```

Here we run `dnearneigh` on each interval of euclidean distance that corresponds to a lag in
1 to 10. To get the number of pairs for each lag order, we simply sum up the cardinality
of the neighbor structure per each lag order and then divide it by two because this sum gives the
total number of neighbors and the total number of pairs will be half this number.
```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  nb <- dnearneigh(coords, (i - 1) * 4823.28, i * 4823.28)
  pairs[i] <- sum(card(nb)) / 2
}
```

Now we create a data frame from the two vectors we create with the lag order values and 
associated euclidean distance values.
```{r}
df <- data.frame(lag_order = 1:10, auto_corr = morans, num_pairs = pairs)
df$euclidean_distance <- df$lag_order * 4823
```

Here we create two different plots, one is a histogram with the number of pairs in each bin, the other
is the spatial correlogram

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = euclidean_distance,y = auto_corr)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(col = "purple", se = FALSE) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
    ylim(-1,1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = df$euclidean_distance)
p2 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x=euclidean_distance,y = num_pairs, fill = as.factor(euclidean_distance))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_text(aes(label=num_pairs), position = position_dodge(width = .9), vjust=-.25) +
  ylim(0, 1.2 * max(pairs)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = df$euclidean_distance)
p1
p2
```

Using `grid.arrange` from the **gridExtra** package, we can combine the two plots into one
image.

```{r}
grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol = 1)
```

Following the same process outlined above, we can make a function that constructs the correlogram
based on the desired lag order, distance band, variable, and coordinates.
```{r}
geoda_correlogram <- function(lag.order, distance, var,coords){
  # Funtion that outputs a spatial correlogram with a bar plot of neighbor pairs
  # Inputs:
  #        lag.order: The desired number of lag orders to be included in the plot
  #        distance: The desired distance band for the lags
  #        var: A variable to analyze the spatial autocorelation
  #        coords: A matrix of coordinates of the same length as var
  # creating vectors to store autocorrelation values and number of pairs
  pairs <- rep(NA, lag.order)

  #loop to calculate number of pairs for each lag order
  for(i in 1:lag.order) {
    nb <- dnearneigh(coords, (i-1) * distance, i * distance)
    pairs[i] <- sum(card(nb)) / 2
  }
  
  # Computing spatial autocorrelation
  nb1 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0 , distance)
  sp <- sp.correlogram(nb1, var, order = lag.order, method = "I", style = "W", randomisation = FALSE, spChk = NULL, zero.policy = TRUE)
  
  # Putting the lag orders, autocorrelation, pairs and distance into a dataframe
  df <- data.frame(lag = 1:lag.order, num_pairs = pairs, auto_corr = sp$res[,1])
  df$euclidean_distance <- df$lag * round(distance, digits = 0)
  
  # Making plots
  p1 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = euclidean_distance,y = auto_corr)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(col = "purple", se = FALSE) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
    ylim(-1,1)  +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = df$euclidean_distance)
  p2 <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x=euclidean_distance,y=num_pairs, fill = as.factor(euclidean_distance))) +
    geom_bar(stat= "identity") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    geom_text(aes(label=num_pairs), position = position_dodge(width = .9), vjust=-.25) +
    ylim(0, 1.2 * max(pairs)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = df$euclidean_distance)
  grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol =1)
}
geoda_correlogram(10, 4823.3, clev.points$sale_price, coords)
```

### Interpretation

The top of the above graph is the actual correlogram. This depicts how spatial autocorrelation
changes with distance. The first dot correpsonds with distances between 0 and 4823 feet. 
The dashed line indicates a spatial autocorrelation of 0. The autocorrelation starts positive
and then fluctates above and below the dashed line.
