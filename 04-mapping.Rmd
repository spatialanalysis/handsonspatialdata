# Basic Mapping

## Introduction {-}

This notebook covers the functionality of the [Basic Mapping](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/3a_mapping/lab3a.html) section of the GeoDa workbook. We refer to that document for details on the methodology, references, etc. The goal of these notes is to approximate as closely as possible the operations carried out using GeoDa by means of a range of R packages.

The notes are written with R beginners in mind, more seasoned R users can probably skip most of the comments
on data structures and other R particulars. Also, as always in R, there are typically several ways to achieve a specific objective, so what is shown here is just one way that works, but there often are others (that may even be more elegant, work faster, or scale better).

For this notebook, we will continue to use the socioeconomic data for 55 New York City sub-boroughs from the GeoDa website. 

### Objectives {-}

After completing the notebook, you should know how to carry out the following tasks
(some of these were also covered in the spatial data handling notes):

- Reading and loading a shapefile

- Creating choropleth maps for different classifications

## Preliminaries {-}

Before starting, make sure to have the latest version of R and of packages that are compiled for the matching version of R (this document was created using R 3.5.1 of 2018-07-02). Also, make sure to set a working directory.^[Use `setwd(directorypath)` to specify the working directory.] We will use a relative path to the working directory to read the data set.

### Load packages {-}

First, we load all the required packages using the `library` command. If you don't have some of these in your system, make sure to install them first as well as
their dependencies.^[Use 
`install.packages(packagename)`.] You will get an error message if something is missing. If needed, just install the missing piece and everything will work after that. 

```{r}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(cartogram)
library(geodaData)
```

### Obtaining the data {-}

The data set used to implement the operations in this workbook is the same as the one we
used for exploratory data analysis. The variables are contained in [NYC Data](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/nyc/) on the GeoDa support
web site. After the file is downloaded, it must be unzipped (e.g., double click 
on the file). The **nyc** folder should be moved to the current working directory
for the path names we use below to work correctly.

We use the `st_read` command from the **sf** package to read in the shape file information.
This provides a brief summary of the geometry of the layer, such as the path (your path will differ),
the driver (ESRI Shapefile), the geometry type (MULTIPOLYGON), bounding box and projection information.
The latter is contained in the **proj4string** information.

```{r}
nyc.bound <- nyc_sf
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
class(nyc.bound) <- c("sf", "data.frame")
```

The projection in question is the ESRI projection 102718, NAD 1983 stateplane New York Long Island 
fips 3104 feet. It does not have an EPSG code (see the spatial data handling notes for further details
on projections), but it has a valid **proj4string**. So, as long as we don't change anything, we should
be OK. We can double check the projection information with  `st_crs`:

```{r}
st_crs(nyc.bound)
```

As we saw in the spatial data handling notes, we can create a quick map using the **sf** `plot` command. This
will result in a choropleth map for the first few variables in the data frame.

```{r}
plot(nyc.bound)
```

## Basic Choropleth Mapping {-}

We now turn to the choropleth mapping functionality included in the **tmap** package.
We have already covered some
functionality of **tmap** in the spatial data handling notes. Here, we will explore 
some further customizations. 

The **tmap** package is extremely powerful,
and there are many features that we do not cover. Detailed information on **tmap** functionality can
be found at [tmap documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/tmap.pdf). In addition, several
extensive examples are listed in 
the review in the *Journal of Statistical Software* by @tennekes_tmap_2018. Another useful resource
is the [chapter on mapping](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) in Lovelace, Nowosad,
and Muenchow's *Geocomputation with R* book.

### Default settings {-}

We have already seen (in the spatial data handling notes) that **tmap** uses the same layered
logic as **ggplot**. The initial command is `tm_shape`, which specifies the geography to which the
mapping is applied. This is followed by a number of `tm_*` options that select the type of map
and several optional customizations.

We follow the example in the GeoDa Workbook and start with a basic choropleth map of the **rent2008**
variable. In **tmap** there are two ways to create a choropleth map. The simplest one, which we
have already seen, is to use the `tm_polygons` command with the variable name as the argument
(under the hood, this is the value for the **col** parameter). In our example, the map
is created with two commands, as shown below. The color coding corresponds to `style = "pretty"`, 
which is the default when the classification breaks are not set explicitly, and the default
values are used (see the discussion of map classifications below).

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_polygons("rent2008")
```

The `tm_polygons` command is a wrapper around two other functions, `tm_fill` and `tm_borders`.
`tm_fill` controls the contents of the polygons (color, classification, etc.), while
`tm_borders` does the same for the polygon outlines.

For example, using the same shape (but no variable), whe obtain the outlines of the
sub-boroughs from the `tm_borders` command.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_borders()
```

Similarly, we obtain a choropleth map without the polygon outlines when we just
use the `tm_fill` command.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) + 
  tm_fill("rent2008")
```

When we combine the two commands, we obtain the same map as with `tm_polygons` (this
illustrates how in R one can often obtain the same result in a number of different ways).

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008") +
  tm_borders()
```

An extensive set of options is available to customize the appearance of the map.
A full list is given in the [documentation page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.1-1/topics/tm_fill) for `tm_fill`.
In what follows, we briefly consider the most common ones.

### Color palette {-}

The range of colors used to depict the spatial distribution of a variable is 
determined by the **palette**. The palette is an argument to the `tm_fill` function.
Several built-in palettes are contained in **tmap**. For example, using 
`palette = "Reds"` would yield the following map for our example.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",palette="Reds") +
  tm_borders()
```

Under the hood, **"Reds"** refers to one of the color schemes supported by the
**RColorBrewer** package (see below).

#### Custom color palettes

In addition to the built-in palettes, customized color ranges can be
created by specifying a vector with the desired colors as anchors. This will create
a spectrum of colors in the map that range between the colors specified in the vector.
For instance, if we used **c("red", "blue")**, the color spectrum would move from red to 
purple, then to blue, with in between shades. In our example:

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",palette=c("red","blue")) +
  tm_borders()
```

Not exactly a pretty picture. In order to mimic the *diverging* scale used in many
of GeoDa's extreme value maps, we insert "white" in between red and blue (but see the next
section for a better approach).

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",palette=c("red","white","blue")) +
  tm_borders()
```

Better, but still not quite there.

#### ColorBrewer {-}

A preferred approach to select a color palette is to chose one of the schemes contained
in the **RColorBrewer** package. These are based on the research of cartographer Cynthia Brewer
([see the colorbrewer2 web site for details](http://colorbrewer2.org)). ColorBrewer makes
a distinction between *sequential* scales (for a scale that goes from low to high),
*diverging* scales (to highlight how values differ from a central tendency), and
*qualitative* scales (for categorical variables). For each scale, a series of single hue and
multi-hue scales are suggested. In the **RColorBrewer** package, these are referred to by a
name (e.g., the "Reds" palette we used above is an example). The full list is contained in the 
[RColorBrewer documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RColorBrewer/versions/1.1-2/topics/RColorBrewer).

There are two very useful commands in this package. One sets a color palette by specifying its
name and the number of desired categories. The result is a character vector with the hex codes of the 
corresponding colors.

For example, we select a sequential color scheme going from blue to green, as **BuGn**, by
means of the command `brewer.pal`, with the number of categories (6) and the scheme as 
arguments. The resulting vector contains the HEX codes for the colors.

```{r}
pal <- brewer.pal(6,"BuGn")
pal
```

Using this palette in our map yields the following result.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",palette="BuGn") +
  tm_borders()
```

The command `display.brewer.pal` allows us to explore different color schemes before
applying them to a map. For example:

```{r}
display.brewer.pal(6,"BuGn")
```



### Legend {-}

There are many options to change the formatting of the legend entries through the **legend.format**
argument. We refer to the `tm_fill` documentation for specific details. 

Often, the automatic title for the legend is not that attractive, since it is simply
the variable name. This can be customized by setting the **title** argument to `tm_fill`.
For example, keeping all the other settings to the default, we change the legend to
**Rent in 2008**.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008") +
  tm_borders()
```

Another important
aspect of the legend is its positioning. This is handled through the `tm_layout` function.
This function has a vast number of options, [as detailed in the documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.1-1/topics/tm_layout).
There are also specialized subsets of layout functions, focused on specific aspects
of the map, such as `tm_legend`, `tm_style` and `tm_format`. We illustrate the positioning of
the legend.

The default is to position the legend inside the map. Often, this default solution is appropriate,
but sometimes further control is needed. The **legend.position** argument to the `tm_layout`
function takes a vector of two string variables that determine both the horizontal
position ("left", "right", or "center") and the vertical position ("top", "bottom",
or "center").

For example, if we would want to move the legend to the lower-right position (clearly
inferior to the default solution), we would use the following set of commands.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008") +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```


There is also the option to position the legend outside the frame of the map. This
is accomplished by setting **legend.outside** to TRUE (the default is FALSE), and
optionally also specify its position by means of **legend.outside.position**.
The latter can take the values "top", "bottom", "right", and "left".

For example, to position the legend outside and on the right, would be accomplished
by the following commands.


```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008") + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = "right")
```

We can also customize the size of the legend, its alignment, font, etc. We refer
to the documentation for specifics.

While there is no obvious way to show the number of observations in each
category (as is the case in GeoDa), **tmap** has an option to add a histogram
to the legend. This is accomplished by setting **legend.hist=TRUE** in the
`tm_fill` command. Further customization is possible, but is not covered here.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",legend.hist=TRUE) + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = "right")
```



### Title {-}

Another functionality of the `tm_layout` function is to set a title for
the map, and specify its position, size, etc. For example, we can 
set the **title**, the **title.size** and the **title.position** as in
the example below (for details, see 
[the `tm_layout` documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.1-1/topics/tm_layout)).
We made the font size a bit smaller (0.8) in order not to overwhelm the map, and positioned it in the
bottom right-hand corner.


```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Rent 2008 NYC Sub-Boroughs", title.size = 0.8, title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```

To have a title appear on top (or on the bottom) of the map, rather than inside
(the default), we need to set the **main.title**
argument of the `tm_layout` function, with the associated **main.title.position**, as
illustrated below (with  **title.size** set to 1.5 to have a larger font).

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Rent 2008 NYC Sub-Boroughs", title.size = 1.5,main.title.position="center")
```


### Border options {-}

So far, we have not specified any arguments to the `tm_borders` function. Common options
are the color for the border lines (**col**), their thickness (**lwd**) and the type
of line (**lty**). The line type is a base R functionality and can be set by specifying
a string (such as "solid", "dashed", "dotted", etc.), or the internal code (e.g., 1 for
solid, 2 for dashed, 3 for dotted). To illustrate this, we set the borders to blue, with
a line width of 2.0 and use a dotted line.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008")  +
  tm_borders(col="blue",lwd=2,lty=3)
```

### Interactive base map {-}

The default **mode** in **tmap** is **plot**, i.e., the standard plotting environment in
R to draw a map on the screen or to a device (e.g., a pdf file). There is also an
interactive mode, which builds upon leaflet to add a basemap and interact with the
map through zooming and identification of individual observations. The interactive
mode is referred to as **view**. We switch between modes by means of the `tmap_mode`
command.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
```

There are a number of different ways in which a basemap can be added. The current preferred
approach is through the `tm_basemap` command. This takes two important arguments. One is
the name of the server. A number of basemaps are supported (and no doubt, that number will
increase over time), but we will illustrate the **OpenStreetMap** option. A second argument
is the degree of transparency, or **alpha** level. This can also be set for the map
itself through `tm_fill`. In practice, one typically needs to experiment a bit to find the
right balance between the information in the choropleth map and the background.

In the example below, we set the **alpha** level for the main map to 0.7, and
for the base layer to 0.5. When we move the pointer over the polygons, their
ID value is shown. A click on a location also gives the value for the variable
that is being mapped. Zooming and panning are supported as well. In addition, it
is possible to stack several layers, but we won't pursue that here.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",alpha=0.7) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_basemap(server="OpenStreetMap",alpha=0.5)
```

Before we proceed, we turn the mode back to **plot**.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

### Saving a map as a file {-}

So far, we have only plotted the map to the screen or an interactive widget. In order
to save the map as an output, we first assign the result of a series of **tmap** commands
to a variable (an object). We can then save this object by means of the `tmap_save` 
function.^[The older function `save_tmap` has been deprecated.]

This function takes the map object as the argument **tm** and the output file name as the
argument **filename**. The default output is a **png** file. Other formats are obtained
by including the proper file extension.

There are many other options in this command, such as specifying the **height**, **width**,
and **dpi**. Details can be found in the 
[list of options](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.1-1/topics/tmap_save).

For example, we assign our rudimentary default map to the variable **mymap** and then save that
to the file **mymap.png**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
mymap <- tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("kids2000") +
  tm_borders()
tmap_save(tm = mymap, filename = "mymap.png")
```

```
## Map saved to mymap.png
```
```
## Resolution: 2100 by 1500 pixels
```
```
## Size: 7 by 5 inches (300 dpi)
```

### Shape centers {-}
GeoDa has functionality invoked from a map window to map or save shape centers, i.e., mean centers
and centroids. The `st_centroid` function is part of **sf** (there is no obvious counterpart
to the mean center functionality). It creates a point simple features layer and contains all the
variables of the original layer.

```{r}
nycentroid <- st_centroid(nyc.bound)
summary(nycentroid)
```

We can now exploit the layered logic of `tm_map` to first draw the outlines of the sub-boroughs
using `tm_borders`, followed by `tm_dots` for the point layer. The `tm_dots` command is a 
specialized version of `tm_symbols`, which has a 
[very large set of options](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.1-1/topics/tm_symbols).

We use two simple options: **size=0.2** to make the points a little larger than the default,
and **col** to set the color to **red**.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(nycentroid) +
  tm_dots(size=0.2,col="red")
```

A close examination of the map reveals that the centroid locations can be problematic for
non-convex polygons.

We can save the centroid point layer as a shape file by means of the `st_write` function we saw earlier
(in the spatial data handling notes).

```{r eval=FALSE}
st_write(nycentroid, "nyc_centroids", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```

```
## Writing layer `nyc_centroids' to data source `nyc_centroids' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'
## Writing 55 features with 34 fields and geometry type Point.
```

## Common Map Classifications {-}

The statistical aspects of a choropleth map are expressed through the
map classification that is used to convert observations for a continuous variable into
a small number of bins, similar to what is the case for a histogram. Different 
classifications reveal different aspects of the spatial distribution of the variable.

In **tmap**, the classification is selected by means of the **style** option in
`tm_fill`. So far, we have used the default, which is set to **pretty**. The latter is
a [base R function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.1/topics/pretty) to
compute a sequence of roughly equally spaced values. Note that the number of intervals that
results is not necessariy equal to **n** (the preferred number of classes), which can seem 
confusing at first.^[For example, in our first map, the default value for n is 5, but the
*pretty* map that is constructed has 6 categories. Other classifications provide more
control over the number of intervals.]

There are many
classification types available in **tmap**, which each correspond to either a base R function, or to a
custom expression contained in the 
[classIntervals functionality](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/classInt/versions/0.1-7/topics/classIntervals).

In this section, we review the quantile map, natural breaks map, and equal intervals map, and
also illustrate how to set custom breaks with their own labels. For a detailed discussion of
the methodological issues associated with these classifications, we refer to the GeoDa Workbook.
We continue to use the same example for **rent2008**.


### Quantile map {-}

A quantile map is obtained by setting **style="quantile"** in the `tm_fill` command.
The number of categories is taken from the **n** argument, which has a default value of 5.
So, for example, using this default will yield a quintile map with five categories
(we specify the type of map in the title through `tm_layout`).

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",style="quantile")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Quintile Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```

We follow the example in the GeoDa Workbook and illustrate a quartile map.
This is created by specifying **n=4**, for four categories with **style="quantile"**. The
rest of the commands are the same as before.


```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",n=4,style="quantile")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Quartile Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```


### Natural breaks map {-}

A natural breaks map^[A natural breaks map uses a nonlinear algorithm to group observations such that the within-group homogeneity is maximized, following the pathbreaking work of @f58 and @j77.] is obtained by specifying the **style = "jenks"** in `tm_fill`. All
the other options are as before. Again, we illustrate this for four categories,
with **n=4**.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",n=4,style="jenks")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Natural Breaks Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```

### Equal intervals map {-}

An equal intervals map for four categories is obtained by setting **n=4**,
and **style="equal"**. The resulting map replicates the result in GeoDa.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",n=4,style="equal")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Equal Intervals Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```


### Custom breaks {-}

For all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to
override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the **breaks**
argument to the `tm_fill` function. To illustrate this, we mimic the example in the GeoDa
Workbook, which uses the variable **kids2000**. The classification results in six categories.
Unlike what is the case in the GeoDa Category Editor, in **tmap** the breaks include a minimum
and maximum (in GeoDa, only the break points themselves need to be specified). As a result, in
order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the **breaks** option
(the values must be in increasing order).

It is always good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting
the break points. For **kids2000**, a `summary` command yields the following results.

```{r}
summary(nyc.bound$kids2000)
```

Following the example in the GeoDa workbook, we set break points at 20, 30, 40, 45, and 50.
In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 65. Our
**breaks** vector is thus `c(0,20,30,40,45,50,60)`.

We also use the same color palette as in the GeoDa Workbook. This is a sequential scale, referred
to as **"YlOrBr"** in ColorBrewer.

The resulting map is identical to the one obtained with GeoDa.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("kids2000",title="Percentage Kids",breaks=c(0,20,30,40,45,50,60),palette="YlOrBr")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Custom Breaks Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```

## Extreme Value Maps {-}

In addition to the common map classifications, GeoDa also supports three types of extreme
value maps^[Extreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (@a94)]: a percentile map, box map, and standard deviation map. For details on the
rationale and methodology behind these maps, we refer to the GeoDa Workbook.

Of the three extreme value maps, only 
the standard deviation map is included as a **style** in **tmap**. To create the
other two, we will need to use the custom breaks functionality. Ideally, we should
create an additional **style**, but that's beyond the scope of these notes.

The three extreme value maps in GeoDa share the same color palette. This is a diverging
scale with 6 categories, corresponding to the ColorBrewer **"RdBu"** scheme. We can
illustrate the associated colors with a `display.brewer.pal` command.

```{r}
display.brewer.pal(6,"RdBu")
```

This seems OK at first sight, but the ranking is the opposite of the one used in GeoDa. Therefore,
to reverse the order, we will need to preface the name with a **"-"**  in the **palette** specification.

### Percentile map {-}

The percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1\%,1-10\%,
10-50\%,50-90\%,90-99\%, and 99-100\%. We can obtain the corresponding breakpoints by means of the
base R `quantile` command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities
as `c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)`. Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included, as we
already pointed out in the discussion of the generic custom break points.

A percentile map is then created by passing the resulting break points to `tm_fill`.
In addition, we can also pass labels for the new categories, using the **labels** option,
for example, as `labels = c("< 1%", "1% - %10", "10% - 50%", "50% - 90%","90% - 99%", "> 99%")`.

#### Extracting a variable from an sf data frame {-}

There is one catch, however. When variables are extracted from an **sf** dataframe, the geometry
is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but
many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the `quantile` function gives
an error.

For example, this is illustrated when we extract the variable **rent2008** and then apply the quantile
function.

```{r error=TRUE}
percent <- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)
var <- nyc.bound["rent2008"]
quantile(var,percent)
```

We remove the geometry by means of the `st_set_geometry(NULL)` operation in **sf**, but it still doesn't work.

```{r error=TRUE}
var <- nyc.bound["rent2008"] %>% st_set_geometry(NULL)
quantile(var,percent)
```

As it happens, the selection of the variable returns a data frame, not a vector, and the `quantile` function
doesn't know which column to use. We make that explicit by taking the first column (and all rows),
as `[,1]`. Now, it works.

```{r error=TRUE}
var <- nyc.bound["rent2008"] %>% st_set_geometry(NULL)
quantile(var[,1],percent)
```

Since we will have to carry out this kind of transformation any time we want to carry out
some computation on a variable, we create a simple helper function to extract the
variable **vname** from the simple features data frame **df**. We have added one extra feature,
i.e., we remove the name of the vector by means of `unname`.

```{r}
get.var <- function(vname,df) {
  # function to extract a variable as a vector out of an sf data frame
  # arguments:
  #    vname: variable name (as character, in quotes)
  #    df: name of sf data frame
  # returns:
  #    v: vector with values (without a column name)
  v <- df[vname] %>% st_set_geometry(NULL)
  v <- unname(v[,1])
  return(v)
}
```

#### A percentile map function {-}

To create a percentile map for the variable **rent2008** from scratch, we proceed in four steps.
First, we set the cumulative percentages to compute the quantiles, in the vector **percent**.
Second, we extract the variable as a vector using our function `get.var`. Next, we 
compute the breaks with the `quantile` function. Finally, we create the map using
`tm_fill` with the **breaks** and **labels** option, and the  palette set to **"-RdBu"** (to
reverse the default order of the colors).

```{r}
percent <- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)
var <- get.var("rent2008",nyc.bound)
bperc <- quantile(var,percent)
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",breaks=bperc,palette="-RdBu",
          labels=c("< 1%", "1% - %10", "10% - 50%", "50% - 90%","90% - 99%", "> 99%"))  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Percentile Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```

We can summarize this in a simple function. Note that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional
arguments could be passed to customize various features of the map (such as the title, legend
positioning, etc.), but we leave that for an exercise. Also, the function assumes (and does not check)
that `get.var` is available. For general use, this should not be assumed.

The minimal arguments we can pass are the variable name (**vnam**), the data frame (**df**), a
title for the legend (**legtitle**, set to **NA** as default, the same default as in `tm_fill`), and
an optional title for the map (**mtitle**, set to **Percentile Map** as the default).

```{r}
percentmap <- function(vnam,df,legtitle=NA,mtitle="Percentile Map"){
  # percentile map
  # arguments:
  #   vnam: variable name (as character, in quotes)
  #   df: simple features polygon layer
  #   legtitle: legend title
  #   mtitle: map title
  # returns:
  #   a tmap-element (plots a map)
  percent <- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)
  var <- get.var(vnam,df)
  bperc <- quantile(var,percent)
  tm_shape(df) +
     tm_fill(vnam,title=legtitle,breaks=bperc,palette="-RdBu",
          labels=c("< 1%", "1% - %10", "10% - 50%", "50% - 90%","90% - 99%", "> 99%"))  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = mtitle, title.position = c("right","bottom"))
}
```

We illustrate this for the **rent2008** variable, without a legend title.

```{r}
percentmap("rent2008",nyc.bound)
```

### Box map {-}

To create a box map, we proceed largely along the same lines as for the percentile map,
using the custom breaks specification. However, there is a complication. The break
points for the box map vary depending on whether lower or upper outliers are present.

In essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and
upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the 
breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast,
when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will
be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be
no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the
minimum value).

The same complication occurs at the upper end of the distribution. When there are
upper outliers, then the last value for the breaks is the maximum value, and the
next to last value is the upper fence. In contrast, when there are no upper
outliers, then the last value is the upper fence, and the next to last is the maximum.
As such, however, this is not satisfactory, because the default operation of the
cuts is to have the **interval.closure="left"**. This implies that the observation
with the maximum value (the break point for the last category) will always be
assigned to the outlier category when there are in fact no outliers. Similarly, the
observation with the minimum value (the break point for the second category) will be
assigned to the first group.

We therefore create a small function to deal with these complications and compute
the break points for a box map. Then we create a function for the box map along
the same lines as for the percentile map.


#### Computing the box map break points {-}

We follow the logic outlined above to create the 7 breakpoints (for the 6 categories) for
the box map. We handle the problem with the interval closure by rounding the maximum
value such that its observation will always fall in the proper category. We need to
distinguish between a minimum and a maximum. For the former, we use the
`floor` function, for the latter, the `ceiling` function.

Our function **boxbreaks** returns the break points. It reuses the same calculations that we
already exploited to compute the fences for the box plot. It takes a vector of observations and optionally
a value for the multiplier as arguments (the default multiplier is 1.5). The function first
gets the quartile values from the `quantile` function (the default is to compute quartiles, so
we do not have to pass cumulative probabilities). Next, we calculate the upper and lower fence
for the given multiplier value.

The break points vector (**bb**) is initialized as a zero vector with 7 values (one more than the
number of categories). The middle three values (3 to 5) will correspond to the first quartile,
median, and third quartile. The first two values are allocated depending on whether there are
lower outliers, and the same for the last two values.


```{r}
boxbreaks <- function(v,mult=1.5) {
  # break points for box map
  # arguments:
  #   v: vector with observations
  #   mult: multiplier for IQR (default 1.5)
  # returns:
  #   bb: vector with 7 break points
  # compute quartile and fences
  qv <- unname(quantile(v))
  iqr <- qv[4] - qv[2]
  upfence <- qv[4] + mult * iqr
  lofence <- qv[2] - mult * iqr
  # initialize break points vector
  bb <- vector(mode="numeric",length=7)
  # logic for lower and upper fences
  if (lofence < qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers
    bb[1] <- lofence
    bb[2] <- floor(qv[1])
  } else {
    bb[2] <- lofence
    bb[1] <- qv[1]
  }
  if (upfence > qv[5]) { # no upper outliers
    bb[7] <- upfence
    bb[6] <- ceiling(qv[5])
  } else {
    bb[6] <- upfence
    bb[7] <- qv[5]
  }
  bb[3:5] <- qv[2:4]
  return(bb)
}
```

We illustrate this for **rent2008**, taking advantage of our `get.var` function.

```{r}
var <- get.var("rent2008",nyc.bound)
boxbreaks(var)
```

In our example, there are both lower and upper outliers. As a result, the first and last
values in the vector are, respectively, the minimum and maximum, and positions 2 and 6 
are taken by the lower and upper fence.


#### A box map function {-}

Our function `boxmap` is designed along the same lines as the percentile map. It assumes
that both `get.var` and `boxbreaks` are available.
Again, the minimal arguments we can pass are the variable name (**vnam**), the data frame (**df**), a
title for the legend (**legtitle**, set to **NA** as default, the same default as in `tm_fill`), and
an optional title for the map (**mtitle**, set to **Percentile Map** as the default). In addition, we
also need to pass a value for the multiplier (**mult**, needed by `boxbreaks`).

```{r}
boxmap <- function(vnam,df,legtitle=NA,mtitle="Box Map",mult=1.5){
  # box map
  # arguments:
  #   vnam: variable name (as character, in quotes)
  #   df: simple features polygon layer
  #   legtitle: legend title
  #   mtitle: map title
  #   mult: multiplier for IQR
  # returns:
  #   a tmap-element (plots a map)
  var <- get.var(vnam,df)
  bb <- boxbreaks(var)
  tm_shape(df) +
     tm_fill(vnam,title=legtitle,breaks=bb,palette="-RdBu",
          labels = c("lower outlier", "< 25%", "25% - 50%", "50% - 75%","> 75%", "upper outlier"))  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = mtitle, title.position = c("right","bottom"))
}
```

Illustrated for the **rent2008** variable:

```{r}
boxmap("rent2008",nyc.bound)
```



### Standard deviation map

A standard deviation map is included in **tmap** as **style="sd"**. We follow the GeoDa
Workbook and return to the **rent2008** variable for our examples. Apart from setting
the style, we also specify the **palette="-RdBu"**. This yields the same map as GeoDa.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008",title="Rent in 2008",style="sd",palette="-RdBu")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Standard Deviation Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```



## Mapping Categorical Variables {-}

In the GeoDa Workbook, the mapping of categorical variables is illustrated by extracting
the classifications from a map as integer values. There doesn't seem to be an obvious 
way to do this for a tmap element. Instead, we will resort to the base R function `cut` to
create integer values for a classification. We will then turn these into **factors** to 
be able to use the **style="cat"** option in `tm_fill`. Note that it is important to have
the variable as a **factor**. When integer values are used as such, the resulting map follows
a standard sequential classification.


#### Creating categories {-}

We use the same example variables as in the GeoDa Workbook and create box map categories
for **kids2000** and **pubast00**. We first extract the variable, using our `get.var` function.

```{r}
var <- get.var("kids2000",nyc.bound)
```

Next, we construct a vector with the boxmap breakpoints using our `boxbreaks` function.

```{r}
vbreaks <- boxbreaks(var)
vbreaks
```

We verify the treatment of lower and upper fences by comparing the result to a `summary`.

```{r}
summary(var)
```

We observe that the first value in the breaks vector is the minimum, indicating lower outliers. However,
the last value is larger than the maximum, indicating the lack of upper outliers. Consequently, our
integer codes will not include the value 6.

We use the boxmap breaks to create a classification by means of the `cut` function. We pass the
vector of observations and the vector of breaks and then specify some important options. The default
in `cut` is to create labels for the categories as strings that show the lower and upper bound. Instead,
we want to have a numeric code, so we set the option **labels=FALSE** (the opposite of the default).
Also, we want to make sure that the mininum value is included if it is the lowest value (the default
is that it would not be) by setting **include.lowest=TRUE**. The result is a vector of integer codes.
Since we only have 55 observations, we can list the result (note the absence of a code of 6).

```{r}
vcat <- cut(var,breaks=vbreaks,labels=FALSE,include.lowest=TRUE)
vcat
```

Finally, we need to add the new variable as a **factor** to the simple features layer, using the
standard **$** notation. We call the new variable **kidscat**, as in the GeoDa Workbook. We could (and should)
turn this whole operation into a function, but we leave that as an exercise for now.

```{r}
nyc.bound$kidscat <- as.factor(vcat)
```

### Unique value map {-}

We are now in a position to create a unique value map for the new variable **kidscat**.  All the
options are as before, except that **style="cat"** and we set **palette="Paired"** to replicate
the map in GeoDa.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("kidscat",style="cat",palette="Paired")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Unique Value Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```


### Co-location map {-}
A special case of a map for categorical variables is a so-called co-location map^[The idea behind a co-location map is the extension of the unique value map concept to a multivariate context. In essence, it is the implementation of ideas related to the principles of map overlay or map algebra applied to categorical maps.Map algebra tends to be geared to applications for raster data, i.e., regular grids. However, since the polygons for the different variables are identical, the same principles can be applied in the context of the categorical maps. The classic reference on the principles of map algebra is @t90],
implemented in GeoDa. This map shows the values for those locations where two
categorical variables take on the same value (it is up to the user to make sure
the values make sense). Further details are given in the GeoDa Workbook.

To replicate a co-location map in R takes a little bit of work. First we need to 
identify the locations that match. Then, in order to make a map that makes sense,
we need to make sure we pick the right colors from the color palette.

We follow the example in the GeoDa Workbook and create a co-location map for
the box map categories for **kids2000** and **pubast00**. We already created the
former, as the new variable **kidscat**. We still need to create a categorical
variable for the latter. We proceed in the same way as before to add the
variable **asstcat** to the **nyc.bound** layer.

```{r}
var2 <- get.var("pubast00",nyc.bound)
vb2 <- boxbreaks(var2)
vcat2 <- cut(var2,breaks=vb2,labels=FALSE,include.lowest=TRUE)
nyc.bound$asstcat <- as.factor(vcat2)
```

A unique value map illustrates the spatial distribution of the categories.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("asstcat",style="cat",palette="Paired")  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Unique Value Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```


#### Identifying the matching locations {-}

We find the positions of the matching locations by checking the equality between
the variables **kidscat** and **asstcat** (note that we need to specify the data frame, using
the **$** notation to select the variable). Since there is no guarantee that the two variables
have the same number of categories (in fact, **kidscat** has categories 1-5, whereas
**asstcat** has 2-5), a direct comparison of the factors might fail. Therefore, we first 
turn the factors into numeric values, and then  do the comparison. In order to make sure
that the resulting integers are the correct categories, we must first convert the
factors into strings, using `as.character`. For example, since our second variable starts
at level 2, a simple `as.numeric` will turn that into 1 (since it is the first level).
Finally, we use the `which` command to find the positions of the observations
where the condition is TRUE. There are 25 such locations (out of 55).

```{r}
v1 <- as.numeric(as.character(nyc.bound$kidscat))
v2 <- as.numeric(as.character(nyc.bound$asstcat))
ch <- v1 == v2
locmatch <- which(ch == TRUE)
locmatch
length(locmatch)
```

Since the two variables use the same coding scheme, and the matching locations have the
same value, we can use either one to extract a categorical value for the unique value map.
We start by initializing a vector of zeros equal in length to the number of observations.
We will use a code of 0 for those locations without a match. We next set the vector
locations with matching values (the indices contained in **locmatch**) to their 
corresponding values in **kidscat**. Finally, we add the new vector to the simple features
layer as a factor.

```{r}
matchcat <- vector(mode="numeric",length=length(nyc.bound$kidscat))
matchcat[locmatch] <- nyc.bound$kidscat[locmatch]
nyc.bound$colocate <- as.factor(matchcat)
```

#### Customizing the color palette {-}

We continue to follow the GeoDa Workbook example and use the color palette for a box map
(since both categorical variables were derived from a box map). This is the **"RdBu"** color
scheme in **RColorBrewer**. However, as we pointed out before, the color order needs to be reversed.
We accomplish this with the `rev` function. In addition, we need to include a color for the 
mismatch category, which we have set to 0. We take a shade of white for those locations, more
specifically, so-called *white smoke*, with a 
HEX code of "#F5F5F5". We add this value in front of the other codes and print the result as a check.


```{r}
pal <- rev(brewer.pal(6,"RdBu"))
pal <- c("#F5F5F5",pal)
pal
```

If we use the full palette, we get the following result.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("colocate",style="cat",palette=pal)  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Co-Location Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```

Upon closer examination of the example in the GeoDa Workbook, we see that the color is shifted down for all
categories. For example, the color for category 2 should be light blue, not
dark blue.

To fix this aspect of the legend, we identify those codes that appear in the **colocate** vector.
This is a bit complicated, since those values are **factors**. As before, first we need to turn
them into strings using `as.character`, and then we turn this into integers by means of `as.numeric`.
We extract the codes that are present with the `unique` operator.
Next, we need to add 1 to those values to be able to refer to positions in a vector (positions start at
1, not 0). Finally, we extract the proper subset of the color palette.


```{r}
mcats <- unique(as.numeric(as.character(nyc.bound$colocate)))
mcats <- mcats+1
colpal <- pal[mcats]
```

We now use this palette in our categorical map to completely replicate the result in GeoDa.

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("colocate",style="cat",palette=colpal)  +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "Co-Location Map", title.position = c("right","bottom"))
```


## Conditional Map {-}

A conditional map^[Discussed at length in @cp10], or facet map, or small multiples, is created by the `tm_facets` command.
This largely follows the logic of the `facet_grid` command in **ggplot** that we covered in the
EDA notes. An extensive set of options is available to customize the facet maps. An in-depth
coverage of all the subtleties is beyond our scope 
(details can be found on the [`tm_facets` documentation page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/2.1-1/topics/tm_facets))


Whereas in GeoDa, the conditions can be based on the original variables, here, we
need to first create the conditioning variables as **factors**. We follow the same procedure as 
before, but here we use the standard `cut` function to create the factors. We specify the
**breaks** argument as 2. 

We follow the example in the GeoDa Workbook and use **hhsiz00** and **forhis08** as
the conditioning variables. The new factors are **cut.hhsiz** and **cut.forhis**. They
are added to the **nyc.bound** layer using the familiar **$** operation.

For example, for **hhsiz00**:

```{r}
nyc.bound$cut.hhsiz <- cut(nyc.bound$hhsiz00,breaks=2)
nyc.bound$cut.hhsiz
```

And, similarly for **cut.forhis**:

```{r}
nyc.bound$cut.forhis <- cut(nyc.bound$forhis08,breaks=2)
nyc.bound$cut.forhis
```

The two new factor variables are used as conditioning variables in the **by** argument
of the `tm_facets` command. The first variable conditions the rows (i.e., is the y-axis),
the second variable conditions the columns (i.e., is the x-axis).

We illustrate this with the **rent2008** variable, using the default map type. Two important
options that affect the look of the conditional map are **free.coords** and **drop.units**.
The default is that each facet map has its own scaling, focused on the relevant observations.
Typically, one wants the same spatial layout in each facet, i.e., all the sub-boroughs in our
example. This is ensured by setting **free.coords=FALSE**. In addition, we want all the 
spatial units to be shown in each facet (the default is to only show those that match the
conditions). This is accomplished by setting **drop.units=FALSE**. The result is as follows:

```{r}
tm_shape(nyc.bound) +
  tm_fill("rent2008") +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_facets(by = c("cut.hhsiz", "cut.forhis"),free.coords = FALSE,drop.units=FALSE)
```

## Cartogram {-}

A final map functionality that we replicate from the GeoDa Workbook is the cartogram^[A cartogram is a map type where the original layout of the areal unit is replaced by a geometric form (usually a circle, rectangle, or hexagon) that is proportional to the value of the variable for the location. This is in contrast to a standard choropleth map, where the size of the polygon corresponds to the area of the location in question. The cartogram has a long history and many variants have been suggested, some quite creative. In essence, the construction of a cartogram is an example of a nonlinear optimization problem, where the geometric forms have to be located such that they reflect the topology (spatial arrangement) of the locations as closely as possible (see @t04, for an extensive discussion of various aspects of the cartogram)]. GeoDa
implements a so-called circular cartogram, where circles represent spatial units and their
size is proportional to a specified variable.

In R, a useful implementation of different types of cartograms is included in the 
package **cartogram**. Specifically, this supports the circular cartogram, as `cartogram_dorling`,
as well as contiguous and non-contiguous cartograms, as, respectively, `cartogram_cont` and
`cartogram_ncont`.

The result of these functions is a simple features layer, which can then be mapped by means
of the usual **tmap** commands.

For example, following the GeoDa Workbook, we take the **rent2008** variable to construct a
circular cartogram. We pass the layer (**nyc.bound**) and the variable to the `cartogram_dorling` 
function. We check that the result is an **sf** object.

```{r}
carto.dorling <- cartogram_dorling(nyc.bound,"rent2008")
class(carto.dorling)
```

We can now map the cartogram with the usual **tmap** command. We just use the
default settings here, but, obviously, all the customizations we covered before
can be applied to the cartogram as well.


```{r}
tm_shape(carto.dorling) +
  tm_fill("rent2008") +
  tm_borders()
```

As a bonus, we illustrate the contiguous cartogram, which stretches the boundaries such that
the spatial units remain contiguous, but take on an area proportional to the variable of
interest (the nonlinear algorithm to compute the new boundaries may take a while). Again,
the result can be mapped in the usual way.


```{r}
carto.cont <- cartogram_cont(nyc.bound,"rent2008")
tm_shape(carto.cont) +
  tm_fill("rent2008") +
  tm_borders()
```

And, finally, a non-contiguous cartogram, which has the spatial units floating in space.


```{r}
carto.ncont <- cartogram_ncont(nyc.bound,"rent2008")
tm_shape(carto.ncont) +
  tm_fill("rent2008") +
  tm_borders()
```
